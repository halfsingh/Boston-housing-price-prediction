# HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION

In this project I predicted prices of houses using Boston house data.
At first I was using a multilayer perceptron model to make predictions
but since I was getting a bad accuracy(about 70%) with it I decided 
to use linear models. So I used a Linear regression model and 
Gradient Booster Regressor for prediction

In this repo you will find -

data_description - description of the data columns

Y_test(housing_prices)3 - prediction using MLP

Y_test(housing_prices)4 - prediction using Linear model
